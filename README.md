# Vision-IoT-Sonar
It is an IoT SONAR System which is capable of precisely detecting the distance and angle of the object placed. Vision is built using Arduino microcontroller and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
The IoT system includes the wirelessely connected LCD Screen which is connected by Bluetooth Module HC-05.

This repository includes the following:
1.servo_test.ino
Arduino code for the Sonar System

2.Processing.pde
This is a processing code for IoT to communicate betweeen laptop bluetooth and the HC05 module with the object at remote location.

3.Object.ino
it is an Arduino code to recieve commands from bluetooth and print on LCD screen

4.Sonar video.zip
This is the video demonstration of our VISION : The IoT SONAR

5.VISION documentation.pdf
